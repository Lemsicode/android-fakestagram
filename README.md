# Fakestagram
An android app replicating the well known app called Instagram using RecyclerView and implementing the heart react button animation.

## Features
* The app utilizes the class RecyclerView to load each content instead of hardcoding everything.
* This was accomplished with the use of an Adapter and a ViewHolder.
* Each content is inside an ArrayList of a class named Post. This makes everything easy in loading them in the adapter.
* The heart react animation when you double tap the image is also implemented in this app.
